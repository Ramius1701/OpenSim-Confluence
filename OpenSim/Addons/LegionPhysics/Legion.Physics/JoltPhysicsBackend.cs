// Legion Grid - Jolt implementation of ILegionPhysicsBackend
//
// ============================ READ THIS FIRST ============================
// The ILegionPhysicsBackend interface is the deliverable. THIS is the real
// backend. As of M1 Task 3 only the LIFECYCLE + LAYER/BROAD-PHASE wiring is
// live (Initialize / Dispose / the filter tables); every other member is still
// a NotImplementedException stub, exactly as scoped. The design sketch lives at
// docs/physics/JoltPhysicsBackend.cs and stays there as the mapping reference.
//
// Jolt binding: JoltPhysicsSharp 2.18.6 (newest still shipping lib/net8.0/),
// single precision (Foundation.Init(false) -> joltc.dll). The Jolt calls below
// are the REAL 2.18.6 surface, verified by reflection against the shipped
// assembly - not the sketch's "shapes to verify". See the MILESTONE1 notes for
// the reference-vs-real API deltas.
//
// The parts worth reading carefully are the ones that are easy to get wrong and
// expensive to discover later:
//   - broad phase / object layer filtering  (BroadPhase region + Initialize)
//   - DontActivate on insert                (CreateBody - Task 4+)
//   - ScaledShape for prim resize           (CreateScaledShape - later)
//   - contact ring buffer                   (LegionContactListener - later)
//   - CharacterVirtual stepping order       (Step - Task 4)

        // from the scene thread. That assumption has now been proven WRONG FOUR times:
        //   1. NarrowPhaseQuery races Update   -> TempAllocator abort (fixed: queries take _simLock)
        //   2. Dispose races Step              -> use-after-free      (fixed: Dispose takes _simLock + _disposed)
        //   3. body Create/Remove races Update -> TempAllocator abort on login-with-physical-object
        //      (fixed: EVERY body op takes _simLock)
        //   4. Update races Update ACROSS REGIONS -> TempAllocator abort with 3 regions stepping at once
        //      (fixed: _simLock is now STATIC - see its comment; joltc's TempAllocator is process-shared,
        //       so a per-instance lock could never protect it).
        // The per-body locking BodyInterface protects per-body DATA, but structural broadphase mutation
        // (add/remove) and the shared LIFO TempAllocator are NOT safe concurrent with _system.Update.
        //
        // THE RULE, no exceptions: every native call that touches ANY PhysicsSystem - Step, the queries,
        // and ALL body ops below - is serialised through the STATIC _simLock (one lock, all regions).

        // stay off _simLock to keep cooking off the hot lock. (Verified 2026-08-02: the [jolt-entry] trace
